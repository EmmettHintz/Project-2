 ReadMe
In addition to your code, you will also create and submit a ReadMe file. Your ReadMe will be a text document
(meaning .txt file, no Word or Google Doc files please) containing the following:
• a description of your game’s theme

    This game is Crazy Dave Zombie Hunt! Inside this game, you play as the iconic character Crazy Dave from Plants vs Zombies and you are
    tasked with taking out as many zombies as you can as they come your way to attack! Pick up pans and splat those zombies, or pick up the
    mysterious (and iconic) taco and go into CrAzY mode demolishing all the zombies (5) that stand before you! 

• details of your custom features and game mechanics

    My custom features include:
        Pan powerup: Arm yourself to splat a singular zombies
        Taco powerup: Go into CrAzY mode and fend off 5 zombies (similar to mario star powerup - temporary invulnerability)
        Pan throw: Action that allows you to sacrifice your armed status to send out a projectile that takes out the first thing that it hits!
        Sprite updating in accordance with character state (armed, unarmed, CrAzY)


• the specific win and lose conditions for the game

    These are zombies that you are dealing with, not just any avoid entity! Getting bitten by one of these zombies will do you in - YOU LOSE!
    The win condition is when you kill 25 zombies, either with pans or in CrAzY mode with tacos
